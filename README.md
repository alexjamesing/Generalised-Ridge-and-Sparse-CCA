# Generalised-Ridge-and-Sparse-CCA
This repository contains MATLAB implementations of 'Generalised Ridge Canonical Correlation Analysis'(1) and 'Generalised Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis' methods (2). Please see the cited publications for more
details on these methods. The authors originally made these procedures available in R, and a detailed vignette (relating to their R implementation) on how 
to run these methods can also be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RGCCA/vignettes/vignette_RGCCA.pdf.
